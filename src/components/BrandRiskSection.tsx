        Practice shows that any competitor can buy ads on your brand. Even the
        giants do this to each other.

        Your niche is also full of competitors who want to capture as much
        relevant and parasitic traffic as possible.
        <br />
        And it costs them little â€” as long as you do nothing.
        <br />
        Your brand is growing, but the money flows away from you.
